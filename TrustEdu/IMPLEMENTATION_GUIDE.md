# Implementation Guide

## Quick Start

Due to PowerShell execution policy restrictions, please run commands in **Command Prompt (cmd)** or **Git Bash** instead of PowerShell.

### Install Dependencies

```bash
# Navigate to frontend directory
cd d:\Hackathon\TrustEdu\frontend

# Install lucide-react icons (run in cmd or git bash, not PowerShell)
npm install lucide-react

# Start the development server
npm start
```

### What Has Been Built

✅ **Design System** 
- Bitcoin DeFi aesthetic with orange gradients and gold accents
- Global CSS with custom animations (float, pulse-glow, shimmer)  
- Theme configuration with design tokens

✅ **Core UI Components**

### Next Steps

1. Install `lucide-react` dependency (use cmd/git bash)
2. Start development server: `npm start`
3. View at http://localhost:3000

The landing page will showcase the stunning Bitcoin DeFi design system!

### Continue Building

After verifying the landing page works, we'll build:
- Enhanced Student Dashboard with charts
- Improved AI Tutor interface
